To use the TrackMe application, you need to allow the application to use your current location. To do so go to Settings -> Apps, choose TrackMe, then click on Permissions and allow Location.

Additionally, ensure the location settings on your device are turned on by going to Settings -> Location, turn on and set the Mode to High accuracy.

Launch the TrackMe app and click Locate.  

TrackMe will show information about your current location, namely latitude, longitude, accuracy, and when the location last updated. 

TrackMe will also show your location on a Google map.  

To refresh your current location within TrackMe click the Locate button.

When TrackMe is launched it will automatically take you to the location settings page if those settings are switched off.
