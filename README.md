TrackMe is a student project undertaken for the Advanced Software Engineering module at the University of Sussex. 

For the application to function as intended the user must turn on their Location setting and set the mode to high accuracy (if not already set by default). The user must also give location permission to the application.

The user must accept the disclaimer message before being allowed to use the application.

Pressing the Locate button will start the main functionality of the application and display the user's current latitude, longitude and the accuracy of this information. The time of the last update will also be displayed. In addition to text information the location will also be shown on the map below. 

The location data will be sent to our Kumulos server and stored there. This can be turned off in the settings page if desired. Provisions have been created for storing the location data locally if this setting is turned off but hasn't been fully integrated.
